        <p class = "main__desc">A big tree is a majestic and imposing plant that can tower over its surroundings, reaching heights of 100 feet or more. Its thick trunk can measure several feet in diameter, and its sprawling branches can extend outwards in every direction, creating a vast canopy of leaves and twigs. The bark of a big tree is rough and textured, with deep furrows and ridges that can provide a home for a variety of insects and animals. Its leaves are often broad and flat, with a dark green hue that provides a striking contrast against the sky.</p>

        <p class="main__textline">Italy is home to many beautiful and diverse forests, each with its unique character and charm. One of the most famous is the Casentinesi Forest National Park, located in the northern part of the country, between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna regions.

            The Casentinesi Forest National Park is a vast protected area, covering over 36,000 hectares of pristine wilderness. The park is known for its rugged mountain landscapes, dense forests, and crystal-clear streams and rivers. It is home to a rich variety of wildlife, including wolves, deer, wild boars, and several species of birds of prey.</p>

                The park is also home to several small villages and hamlets, each with their unique traditions and culture. Visitors can explore the charming medieval town of Poppi or visit the Monastery of Camaldoli, a peaceful retreat nestled deep in the forest.</p>
